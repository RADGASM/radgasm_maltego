## Maltego for OSINT investigations:
Maltego is a data mining tool that mines a variety of open-source data resources and uses that data to 
create graphs for analyzing connections.

1. You'll need to download Maltego into your VirtualBox directly from their website. Find the download based on your OS of which I'm using Kali == Linux. This is the company that created Maltego: https://www.paterva.com/downloads.php

2. The download should be relatively quick. Open up the terminal to the 'Downloads' folder and unpack the file via 'sudo dpkg -i [file-name]' command:
